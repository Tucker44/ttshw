Exercise 1
Familiarize yourself with the heights data set provided with the modelr package.

>install.package("modelr")
>install.package("tidyverse")
>library(modelr)
>heights

Exercise 2
Create a list of formulas for modeling income with:
*height
*height * weight
*linear combination of all variables

> model1 <- lm(income ~ height, data = heights)
> summary(model1)

> model2 <- lm(income ~ height + weight, data = heights)
> summary(model2)

> model3 <- lm(income ~ height + weight + age + marital + sex + education + afqt, data = heights)
> summary(model3)

Exercise 3
From the data, remove rows containing NAâ€™s. Fit the linear model with the formulas from exercise 2.

> completerecords <- na.omit(heights)
> model1 <- lm(income ~ height, data = heights)
> heights

Exercise 4
For each fit, calculate RMSE.

Came up as NaN

Exercise 5
For each model, add residuals to the data and plot their distribution. (Hint: use lift_dl().)
> install.package("ggfortify")
> library(ggfortify)
> autoplot(model1)
