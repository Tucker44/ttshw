Accept the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them
firstname=input("FirstName: ")
# assign users first name
lastname=input("LastName: ")
# assign users first name
print(lastname, firstname)
# print them in reverse order
FirstName: Tucker
LastName: Doherty

Accept an integer (n) and compute the value of n+nn+nnn
# accept input, input must be an integer
n=int(input("integer: "))
​
# comput n + nn
t=str(n)
nn=t+t
nnn=t+t+t
result=n+int(nn)+int(nnn)
print(result)
​
# add nnn
integer: 3

Ask the user "What country are you from?" then print the following statement: "I have heard that [input] is a beautiful country!"
# ask user what country are you from
#input("What country are you from?")
# make input a variable
country=input("What country are you from?: ")
# print the message
print("I have hear that "+country+" is a beautiful country!")
What country are you from?: USA
I have hear that USA is a beautiful country!
Write a for loop that multiplies the number 4 by all the integers from 0 to 10 and prints the following for each: "4 multiplied by [i] is [x]"
count = 1
# number for loop
# loop 4 is being multiplied
while (count < 11): # count less than 11, which is technically 10
    i = count # variable
    stringOne = str(i) #strings variable
    x = i * 4 # multiplies variable by 4
    stringTwo = str(x) # answer to x = i x 4
    print ("4 x " + stringOne + " = " + stringTwo) # prints the loop with answers
    count = count + 1 # keep list from being continuous, stops at 10
4 x 1 = 4
4 x 2 = 8
4 x 3 = 12
4 x 4 = 16
4 x 5 = 20
4 x 6 = 24
4 x 7 = 28
4 x 8 = 32
4 x 9 = 36
4 x 10 = 40
Print a multiplication table that matches the following. Use two nested for loops to achieve this.

for i in range(1,11): #range for row
    for j in range (1,11): #range for column
        k = i*j #multiply row and column
        print (k, end=" ") #print the function k=i*j
    print( )
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 
4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 
6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 
7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 
8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 
9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 
Is a String Immutable in Python?
Python strings are immutable. You can't change the value of the string, only the reference.

What is the output of x AND explain why that is the output for:
x = 36 / 4 * (3 +  2) * 4 + 2
x = 36 / 4 * (3 +2) * 4 + 2
print(x)
#PEMDAS

TITUS QUESTION 4: What is the output of the following Python code

x = 10 y = 50 if (x ** 2 > 100 and y < 100): print(x, y)

x = 10
y = 50
if (x ** 2 > 100 and y < 100):
    print(x,y)
    #WILL NOT PRINT
The answer is nothing because the if statement is true

TITUS QUESTION 5: What is the output of the following addition (+) operator, and why does this code chunk execute this way?

a = [10, 20] b = a b += [30, 40] print(a) print(b)

a = [10, 20]
b = a
b += [30, 40]
print(a)
print(b)
#appending the b list, which makes it also happen to a
[10, 20, 30, 40]
[10, 20, 30, 40]
